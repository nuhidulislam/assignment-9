            <p className="">To enrich your vocabulary effectively, immerse yourself in a variety of reading materials, from books and articles to poetry and blogs, across different genres and subjects. 
                This exposes you to diverse language, phrases, and ideas. 
                When encountering new words, take the time to understand their meanings and usage, 
                and make a habit of noting them down in a journal, alongside example sentences. 
                Actively use these words in conversation and writing to reinforce your 
                understanding.</p>
